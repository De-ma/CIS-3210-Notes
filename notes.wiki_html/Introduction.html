<ul>
<li>
A computer network is a set of computers connected together for the purpose of sharing resources. The <span id="Introduction to Networking-What is the internet?-Internet"></span><strong id="Internet">Internet</strong> is the most widely used one in the world today.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
billions of connected computing devices:

<ul>
<li>
hosts = end systems

<li>
running network apps

</ul>
<li>
Communication links:

<ul>
<li>
fiber, copper, radio, satellite

<li>
transmission rate:

<ul>
<li>
bandwidth

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data):

<ul>
<li>
devices that server as hubs between communication links and forward arriving packets from their incoming links to the outgoing links

<li>
routers and switches

</ul>
</ul>

A <span id="Introduction to Networking-What's the internet: &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; view-route"></span><strong id="route">route</strong> is a sequence of links and packet switches travered by a packet on its way from the sending host to the destination host

<li>
<span id="Introduction to Networking-What's the internet: &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; view-Internet Service Providers"></span><strong id="Internet Service Providers">Internet Service Providers</strong> (ISP) are network of packet switchers and links that provide the communication infrastructure to the end users

<em>Internet</em>: "network of networks":

<ul>
<li>
Interconnected ISPs

</ul>
<li>
<em>Protocols</em> control sneding, receiving of messages:

<ul>
<li>
A protocol is a system of rules that allows multiple entites to communicate information to each other

<li>
e.g., TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11

</ul>
<li>
Standards organization developing Internet standards:

<ul>
<li>
IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)

</ul>
<li>
RFC (Request of comments):

<ul>
<li>
e.g. protocols including TCP, IP, HTTP, and SMTP

</ul>
<li>
IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee: Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards

<ul>
<li>
<em>infrastructure that provides services to applications</em>:

<ul>
<li>
Web, VoIP, email, gaames, e-commerce, social nets, ...

</ul>
<li>
<em>provides prograamming interfaace to apps - Socket interface</em>:

<ul>
<li>
hooks that allow sending and receiving app programs to "connect" to Internet

<li>

</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Network Sockets"><h3 id="Network Sockets" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Network Sockets">Network Sockets</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Since every hosts (computer) usually has <span id="Introduction to Networking-Network Sockets-multiple programs"></span><strong id="multiple programs">multiple programs</strong> that communicate over the network, it's not enough to deliver data to a specific host - we need to deliver it to a specific program

<li>
This is  done using sockets - software interfaces that allow a process living on one host to communicate over the network with anohter process, typically living on another host

<ul>
<li>
However, you can communicate locally using sockets - more on that later

</ul>
<li>
A socket is an interface for an application to connect to a host's network stack (part of the OS).

<ul>
<li>
In networking jargon, a stack is a collection of software technologies or protocols working together

<li>
E.g. the TCP/IP stack used by the internet

</ul>
<li>
After connecting, an application is able to bidirectionally exchange data with other processes on the same or another host.

<li>
Sockets are tied to specific network protocols, as we will see when we get to Unix sockets

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
network edge:

<ul>
<li>
hosts: clients and servers

<li>
servers often in data centers

</ul>
<li>
access networks, physical media: wired, wireless communication links

<li>
network core:

<ul>
<li>
interconnected routers

<li>
network of networks

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Network Core"><h3 id="Network Core" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Network Core">Network Core</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
mesh of interconnected routers

<li>
packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into <em>packets</em>

<ul>
<li>
forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination

<li>
each packet transmitted at full link capactiy

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Host: sends <em>packets</em> of data
</p>

<ul>
<li>
host sending function:

<ul>
<li>
takes application message

<li>
breaks into smaller chunks, known as <em>packets</em>, of length <em>L</em> bits

<li>
transmits packet into access network at <em>transmission rate R</em>

<ul>
<li>
link transmission raate, aka link <em>capacity</em> or <em>link bandwidth</em>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L (bits) / R (bits/sec)
</p>

<p>
Packet-switching: store-and-forward
</p>

<ul>
<li>
takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R bps

<li>
<em>store and forward</em>: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link

<li>
end-end delay = 2L/R (assuming zero propagation delay)

</ul>

<p>
one-hope numerical example:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
L = 7.5 Mbits

<li>
R = 1.5 Mbps

<li>
one-hop transmission delay = L/R = 5 sec

</ol>

<p>
Packet-switching: queueing delay and packet loss
</p>

<p>
queueing and loss:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
if arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link for a period of time:

<ul>
<li>
packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link

<li>
packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions"><h3 id="Two key network-core functions" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions">Two key network-core functions</a></h3></div>

<p>
<em>routing</em>: determines source-destination route taaken by packets
<em>forwarding</em>: move pacakets from router's input to appropriate router output
</p>

<p>
Alternative core: circuit switching
</p>

<p>
end-end resources allocated to, reserved for "call" between source &amp; dest:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
in diagram, each link has four circuits.

<ul>
<li>
call gets 2nd circuit in top link and 1st circuit in right link

</ul>
<li>
dedicated resources: no sharing

<ul>
<li>
circuit-like (guaranteed) performance

</ul>
<li>
circuit segment idle if not used by call (no sharing)

<li>
commonly used in tranditional telephone networks

</ul>

<p>
Packet switching versus circuit switching
</p>

<p>
example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
1 Mb/s link

<li>
each user:

<ul>
<li>
100 kb/s when "active"

<li>
active 10% of the time

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Using <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-Circuit switching"></span><strong id="Circuit switching">Circuit switching</strong>, how many users are allowed?
</p>

<p>
Each user reserves 100 Kb/s, no sharing, so maximum 10 users allowed (1 Mbps/100 Kbps)
</p>

<p>
Using <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-Packet Switching"></span><strong id="Packet Switching">Packet Switching</strong>, how many users are allowed?
</p>

<p>
Technically, no limit, as long as <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-&lt;= 10 users are active"></span><strong id="&lt;= 10 users are active">&lt;= 10 users are active</strong> at the same time. then, what's the probability of that, assuming we haave <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-35"></span><strong id="35">35</strong> users in total?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
99.96%

<li>
Packet switching allows more users to use network!

</ul>
