<ul>
<li>
A computer network is a set of computers connected together for the purpose of sharing resources. The <span id="Introduction to Networking-What is the internet?-Internet"></span><strong id="Internet">Internet</strong> is the most widely used one in the world today.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
billions of connected computing devices:

<ul>
<li>
hosts = end systems

<li>
running network apps

</ul>
<li>
Communication links:

<ul>
<li>
fiber, copper, radio, satellite

<li>
transmission rate:

<ul>
<li>
bandwidth

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data):

<ul>
<li>
devices that server as hubs between communication links and forward arriving packets from their incoming links to the outgoing links

<li>
routers and switches

</ul>
</ul>

<li>
A <span id="Introduction to Networking-What's the internet: &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; view-route"></span><strong id="route">route</strong> is a sequence of links and packet switches travered by a packet on its way from the sending host to the destination host

<li>
<span id="Introduction to Networking-What's the internet: &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; view-Internet Service Providers"></span><strong id="Internet Service Providers">Internet Service Providers</strong> (ISP) are network of packet switchers and links that provide the communication infrastructure to the end users

<li>
<em>Internet</em>: "network of networks":

<ul>
<li>
Interconnected ISPs

</ul>
<li>
<em>Protocols</em> control sneding, receiving of messages:

<ul>
<li>
A protocol is a system of rules that allows multiple entites to communicate information to each other

<li>
e.g., TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11

</ul>
<li>
Standards organization developing Internet standards:

<ul>
<li>
IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)

</ul>
<li>
RFC (Request of comments):

<ul>
<li>
e.g. protocols including TCP, IP, HTTP, and SMTP

</ul>
<li>
IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee: Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards

</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-What's the internet: a service view"><h3 id="What's the internet: a service view" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-What's the internet: a service view">What's the internet: a service view</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
<em>infrastructure that provides services to applications</em>:

<ul>
<li>
Web, VoIP, email, gaames, e-commerce, social nets, ...

</ul>
<li>
<em>provides prograamming interfaace to apps - Socket interface</em>:

<ul>
<li>
hooks that allow sending and receiving app programs to "connect" to Internet

<li>
provides service options, analogous to postal server

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Network Sockets"><h3 id="Network Sockets" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Network Sockets">Network Sockets</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Since every hosts (computer) usually has <span id="Introduction to Networking-Network Sockets-multiple programs"></span><strong id="multiple programs">multiple programs</strong> that communicate over the network, it's not enough to deliver data to a specific host - we need to deliver it to a specific program

<li>
This is  done using sockets - software interfaces that allow a process living on one host to communicate over the network with anohter process, typically living on another host

<ul>
<li>
However, you can communicate locally using sockets - more on that later

</ul>
<li>
A socket is an interface for an application to connect to a host's network stack (part of the OS).

<ul>
<li>
In networking jargon, a stack is a collection of software technologies or protocols working together

<li>
E.g. the TCP/IP stack used by the internet

</ul>
<li>
After connecting, an application is able to bidirectionally exchange data with other processes on the same or another host.

<li>
Sockets are tied to specific network protocols, as we will see when we get to Unix sockets

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
network edge:

<ul>
<li>
hosts: clients and servers

<li>
servers often in data centers

</ul>
<li>
access networks, physical media: wired, wireless communication links

<li>
network core:

<ul>
<li>
interconnected routers

<li>
network of networks

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Network Core"><h3 id="Network Core" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Network Core">Network Core</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
mesh of interconnected routers

<li>
packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into <em>packets</em>

<ul>
<li>
forward packets from one router to the next, across links on path from source to destination

<li>
each packet transmitted at full link capactiy

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Host: sends <em>packets</em> of data
</p>

<ul>
<li>
host sending function:

<ul>
<li>
takes application message

<li>
breaks into smaller chunks, known as <em>packets</em>, of length <em>L</em> bits

<li>
transmits packet into access network at <em>transmission rate R</em>

<ul>
<li>
link transmission raate, aka link <em>capacity</em> or <em>link bandwidth</em>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L (bits) / R (bits/sec)
</p>

<p>
Packet-switching: store-and-forward
</p>

<ul>
<li>
takes L/R seconds to transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R bps

<li>
<em>store and forward</em>: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link

<li>
end-end delay = 2L/R (assuming zero propagation delay)

</ul>

<p>
one-hope numerical example:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
L = 7.5 Mbits

<li>
R = 1.5 Mbps

<li>
one-hop transmission delay = L/R = 5 sec

</ol>

<p>
Packet-switching: queueing delay and packet loss
</p>

<p>
queueing and loss:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
if arrival rate (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link for a period of time:

<ul>
<li>
packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link

<li>
packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions"><h3 id="Two key network-core functions" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions">Two key network-core functions</a></h3></div>

<p>
<em>routing</em>: determines source-destination route taaken by packets
<em>forwarding</em>: move pacakets from router's input to appropriate router output
</p>

<p>
Alternative core: circuit switching
</p>

<p>
end-end resources allocated to, reserved for "call" between source &amp; dest:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
in diagram, each link has four circuits.

<ul>
<li>
call gets 2nd circuit in top link and 1st circuit in right link

</ul>
<li>
dedicated resources: no sharing

<ul>
<li>
circuit-like (guaranteed) performance

</ul>
<li>
circuit segment idle if not used by call (no sharing)

<li>
commonly used in tranditional telephone networks

</ul>

<p>
Packet switching versus circuit switching
</p>

<p>
example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
1 Mb/s link

<li>
each user:

<ul>
<li>
100 kb/s when "active"

<li>
active 10% of the time

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Using <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-Circuit switching"></span><strong id="Circuit switching">Circuit switching</strong>, how many users are allowed?
</p>

<p>
Each user reserves 100 Kb/s, no sharing, so maximum 10 users allowed (1 Mbps/100 Kbps)
</p>

<p>
Using <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-Packet Switching"></span><strong id="Packet Switching">Packet Switching</strong>, how many users are allowed?
</p>

<p>
Technically, no limit, as long as <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-&lt;= 10 users are active"></span><strong id="&lt;= 10 users are active">&lt;= 10 users are active</strong> at the same time. then, what's the probability of that, assuming we haave <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Two key network-core functions-35"></span><strong id="35">35</strong> users in total?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
99.96%

<li>
Packet switching allows more users to use network!

</ul>

<p>
Assuming we have 35 users in total. Also, Each user is active in 10% of time, which means that the probability that a user is active is 0.1 
Let X denote the number of active users, P(X&lt;=10) the probability thaat there are &lt;= 10 active users (transmitting), and P(X&gt;=11) the probability that there are 11 or more active users. Obviously, 1 = P(X&lt;=10) + P(X&gt;=11)
</p>


<p>
Is packet switching a "slam dunk winner"?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
great for bursty data

<ul>
<li>
resource sharing

<li>
simpler, no call setup

</ul>
<li>
excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss 

<ul>
<li>
protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control

</ul>
</ul>


<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Network of networks"><h3 id="Network of networks" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Network of networks">Network of networks</a></h3></div>

<p>
Question: give <em>millions</em> of access ISPs, how to connect them together?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
at center: small # of well-connected large networks:

<ul>
<li>
"tier-1" commercial ISPs (e.g., Level 3, Sprint, AT&amp;T, NTT), national &amp; international coverage

<li>
content provider network (e.g., Google): private network that connects it data centers to Internet, often bypaassing tier-1, regional ISPs

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Delay, Loss, Throughput in networks"><h3 id="Delay, Loss, Throughput in networks" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Delay, Loss, Throughput in networks">Delay, Loss, Throughput in networks</a></h3></div>

<p>
How do loss and delay occur?
Packets <em>queue</em> in router buffers
</p>
<ul>
<li>
packet arrival rate to link (temporarily) exceeds output link capacity

<li>
packet queue, wait for turn

</ul>

<p>
4 types of delay:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
transmission delay: amount of time required to push all the packet's bits into the wire. the delay caused by the data-rate of the link

<ul>
<li>
transmission delay = length/size of data packet / bandwidth of network

</ul>
<li>
queueing delay: amount of time required waiting in the queue before its taken to execution

<ul>
<li>
depends on the ocngestion in the network

</ul>
<li>
nodal processing: time taken by the processor to process the data packets

<ul>
<li>
depends on the speed ofthe processor 

</ul>
<li>
propagation delay: time taken for one bit to travel from sender to received end of the link.

<ul>
<li>
propagration delay = distance between sender and receiver / transmission speed

</ul>
</ol>


<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Packet loss"><h3 id="Packet loss" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Packet loss">Packet loss</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
queue (aka buffer) preceding link in buffer has finite capacity

<li>
packet arriving to full queue dropped (aka lost)

<li>
lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end sysetm, or not at all

<li>
What do "real" internet delay &amp; loss look like?

<ul>
<li>
<span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Packet loss-traceroute"></span><strong id="traceroute">traceroute</strong> program: provides delay measurement from source to router along end-end Internet path towards destination For all i:

<ul>
<li>
sends three packets that will reach router i on path towards destination

<li>
router i will return packets to sender

<li>
sender times interval between transmission and reply.

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Throughput"><h3 id="Throughput" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Throughput">Throughput</a></h3></div>

<ul>
<li>
throughput: rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver

<ul>
<li>
instantaneous: rate at given point in time

<li>
average: rate over longer period of time

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Protocol Layers"><h3 id="Protocol Layers" class="header"><a href="#Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Protocol Layers">Protocol Layers</a></h3></div>

<p>
Networks are complex, with many "pieces":
</p>
<ul>
<li>
hosts

<li>
routers

<li>
links of various media

<li>
applications

<li>
protocols

<li>
hardware, software

</ul>

<p>
layers: each layer implements a service
</p>
<ul>
<li>
via its own internal-layer actions

<li>
relying on services provided by layer below

</ul>

<p>
Why layering?
</p>

<p>
dealing with complex systems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
explicit structure allows identification, relationship of complex system's pieces

<ul>
<li>
layered <span id="Introduction to Networking-Structure of the Internet-Protocol Layers-reference model"></span><strong id="reference model">reference model</strong> for discussion

</ul>
<li>
modularization eases maintenance, updating of system

<ul>
<li>
change of implementation of layer's service transparent to rest of system

<li>
e.g., change in gate procedure doesn't affect rest of system

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Internet Protocol Stack *

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
application: supporting network applications

<ul>
<li>
e.g., FTP, SMTP, HTTP

</ul>
<li>
transport: process-process data transfer

<ul>
<li>
TCP, UDP

</ul>
<li>
network: routing of datagrams from source to destination

<ul>
<li>
IP, routing protocols

</ul>
<li>
link: data transfer between neighboring network elements

<ul>
<li>
Ethernet, 802.111 (WiFi), PPP

</ul>
<li>
physical: bits "on the wire"

</ul>

<p>
ISO/OSI reference model
</p>
<ul>
<li>
presentation: allow application to interpret meaning of data, e.g., encryption, compression, machine specific conventions

<li>
session: synchronization, checkpointing, recovery of data exchange

<li>
Internet stack "missing" these layers!

how bad guys can attack computers networks

<li>
how we can defend networks against attacks

<li>
how to design architectures that arae immune to attacks

</ul>
<li>
Internet not originally designed with (much) security in mind

<p>
Bad guys: put malware into hosts via Interent
</p>
<ul>
<li>
malware can get in host from:

<ul>
<li>
virus: self-replicating infection by receiving/executing object (e.g., e-mail attachment)

<li>
worm: self-replicating infection by passively receiving object that gets itself executed

</ul>
<li>
Spyware malware can record keystrokes, websites visited, upload info to collection site

<li>
infected host can be enrolled in botnet, used for spam, DDoS attacks

</ul>

<p>
Bad guys: attack server, network infrastructure 
</p>

<p>
Denial of Service (DoS): attackers make resources (server, bandwidth) unavailable to legitimate traffice by overwhelming resource with bogus traffic
</p>

<ol>
<li>
