<ul>
<li>
HTML - the markup language for encoding text and images

<ul>
<li>
Hypertext Markup Language

</ul>
<li>
Web page

<ul>
<li>
A web page consists of objects: HTML file, as well as various resources: images, audio, video, JavaScript code, etc

<ul>
<li>
if a Web page contains HTML text and give JPEG images, then the Web page has six objects: the base HTML file plus the five images

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Typical Web communications over the network consists of clients requesting resources from servers, and occasionally sending some data back

<li>
HTTP - the protocol for exchanging data between content providers (servers) and content consumers (browsers on clients)

<ul>
<li>
hypertext transfer protocol

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Web &amp; HTTP
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Each object is addressable by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), e.g.,

</ul>
 
 
<p>
 socs.uoguelph.ca/~xlin08/img/xlin.jpg
</p>
 
<p>
 host name         path name
</p>
 
<p>
To display a page:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Browser (HTTP client) requests page from a web server (HTTP server)

<li>
parses page and finds URLs to referenced objects

<li>
requests objects

<li>
displays web page text and objects in browser window

</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-HTTP overview"><h3 id="HTTP overview" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-HTTP overview">HTTP overview</a></h3></div>

<p>
HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
</p>
<ul>
<li>
an application layer protocol 

<li>
client/server model

<ul>
<li>
client: browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and "displays" Web objects, e.g., Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (IE), Firefox, Safari.

<li>
server: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects, e.g., Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS).

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP communication use TCP:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80

<li>
server accepts TCP connection from client

<ul>
<li>
starts a sepaarate thread to process client requests, or allocates one from a thread pool

</ul>
<li>
HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)

<li>
TCP connection close

</ul>

<p>
HTTP - Design Requirements 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entites, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or another event. 

</ul>
  
<ul>
<li>
So we need:

<ul>
<li>
format for messages from client to server, e.g. ask server for stuff or send the server stuff

<li>
format for messages from server to client, e.g. acknowledge request and send data to client, indicate inability to process request.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
HTTP is "stateless" - server maintains no information about pas client requests

<li>
Two htypes of HTTP messages: request, response

<li>
basic requests: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE

<ul>
<li>
GET: requests a page

<li>
HEAD: similar to GET but noobject returned, just a header

<li>
POST: request a page based on filling out a form

<li>
PUT: upload an object to a server

<li>
DELETE: delete an object from a server

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP request mesaage exmaple
</p>

<ul>
<li>
HTTP request message:

<ul>
<li>
ASCII (human-readable format)

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP response status codes
</p>

<ul>
<li>
status code appears in 1st line in server-to-client response message.

<li>
200 OK

<li>
301 Moved Permanently

<li>
400 Bad Request

<li>
404 Not Found

<li>
505 HTTP Version Not Suppported

</ul>

<p>
Persistent and Non-persistent HTTP
</p>

<p>
Original HTTP (1.0) - non-persistent HTTP
</p>
<ul>
<li>
at most one object sent over TCP connection

<ul>
<li>
connection then closed

</ul>
<li>
downloading multiple objects required multiple connections

<ul>
<li>
browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Persistent HTTP (1.1) 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, server

<li>
RFC 7230 family

</ul>

<p>
We will look at RTT (round-trip time) to compare performance time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
</p>


<p>
RTT: time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
</p>

<p>
HTTP respone time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
one RTT to initiate TCP connection

<li>
one RTT for HTTP request and a few butes of HTTP response to return

<li>
file transmission time

<li>
non persistent (total) HTTP response time = 2RTT + file transmission time 

</ul>
  
  
<ul>
<li>
Non-persistent HTTP response time:

<ul>
<li>
for every object:

<ul>
<li>
one RTT to initiate TCP connection

<li>
one RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return 

<li>
file transmission time

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Persistent HTTP:

<ul>
<li>
server leaves connection open aafter sending response

<li>
subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection

<li>
client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object 

<li>
as little as one RTT for all the referenced objects

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Evolution of HTTP
</p>

<ul>
<li>
HTTP 2.0 was published in 2015 and is adopted by the major browsers

<ul>
<li>
An update on 1.1 that involves various performance upgrades 

<li>
RFC 7540 

</ul>
</ul>
	  
<ul>
<li>
Any modern web server should implement at least HTTP 1.1

<li>
The majority of web traaffic now is HTTP 1.1 or 2.0

<li>
Exceptions

<ul>
<li>
Some low-tech clients (e.g. Wget) still use 1.0

<li>
Internet chatter indicates that bots often use 1.0

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie"><h3 id="User-server state: Cookie" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie">User-server state: Cookie</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
HTTP provides no provisions for maintaining state 

<li>
However, modern apps often need per-client state

<ul>
<li>
user session state (Web e-mail, online banking)

<li>
authorization

<li>
etc.

</ul>
<li>
This is done using <span id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie-cookies"></span><strong id="cookies">cookies</strong> - formatted text maintained by the browser at the request of a web site

<ul>
<li>
typically maintained in a file on client's computer 

<li>
may include infomration used by application identify a user, such as key to a database entry with account data

</ul>
<li>
Cookies can be a source of privacy and security concerns

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Cookie interaction

<ul>
<li>
server sets a cookie by inclusing <span id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie-Set-cookie header"></span><strong id="Set-cookie header">Set-cookie header</strong> in response to a request

<li>
when sending a request to a server for which it has a stored cookie, client includes <span id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie-Cookie header"></span><strong id="Cookie header">Cookie header</strong> and the associated text

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Cookies components:

<ol>
<li>
Set-cookie header line of HTTP response message

<li>
Cookie header line in next HTTP request message

<li>
Cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser 

<li>
back-end databaase at Web site

</ol>
</ul>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Susan always access Internet from PC

<li>
visits specific e-commerce site for first time

<li>
when initial HTTP requests arrives at site, site creates:

<ul>
<li>
unique ID

<li>
entry in backend database for ID

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Web Cookies: keeping "state"
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What cookies can be used for:

<ul>
<li>
authorization

<li>
shopping carts

<li>
recommendations

<li>
user session state (Web e-mail, onine banking)

</ul>
<li>
How to keep state:

<ul>
<li>
protocol endpoints: maintain state at sender/receiver over multiple transactions

<li>
cookies: http messages carry state

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
cookies and privacy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you

<li>
you may supply name and e-mail to sites

</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-Web caches (proxy server)"><h3 id="Web caches (proxy server)" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-Web caches (proxy server)">Web caches (proxy server)</a></h3></div>

<p>
goal: satisfy client request without involving origin server
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Client may configure browser to use proxy:

<ul>
<li>
all HTTP requests sent to proxy

<li>
if proxy has fresh copy of requested page, it returns stored copy

<li>
if not, it sends its owen GET request to retrieve page from "origin server", sends page to client anad stores a copy

</ul>
<li>
What about pages that may change?

<ul>
<li>
origin server can place limit on time object can be cached

<li>
proxy can issue conditional GET - "If-modified-since:" header

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Cache acts as both client and server:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
server for original requesting client

<li>
client to origin server

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
typically cache is installed by ISP (university, company, residential ISP)

<li>
why web caching?

<ul>
<li>
reduce response time for client request

<li>
reduce traffic on institution's access link

<li>
internet dense with caches: enables "poor" content providers to effectively deliver conent (so too does P2P file sharing)

</ul>
</ul>
