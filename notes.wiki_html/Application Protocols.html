<ul>
<li>
HTML - the markup language for encoding text and images

<ul>
<li>
Hypertext Markup Language

</ul>
<li>
Web page

<ul>
<li>
A web page consists of objects: HTML file, as well as various resources: images, audio, video, JavaScript code, etc

<ul>
<li>
if a Web page contains HTML text and give JPEG images, then the Web page has six objects: the base HTML file plus the five images

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Typical Web communications over the network consists of clients requesting resources from servers, and occasionally sending some data back

<li>
HTTP - the protocol for exchanging data between content providers (servers) and content consumers (browsers on clients)

<ul>
<li>
hypertext transfer protocol

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Web &amp; HTTP
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Each object is addressable by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), e.g.,

</ul>
 
 
<p>
 socs.uoguelph.ca/~xlin08/img/xlin.jpg
</p>
 
<p>
 host name         path name
</p>
 
<p>
To display a page:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Browser (HTTP client) requests page from a web server (HTTP server)

<li>
parses page and finds URLs to referenced objects

<li>
requests objects

<li>
displays web page text and objects in browser window

</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-HTTP overview"><h3 id="HTTP overview" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-HTTP overview">HTTP overview</a></h3></div>

<p>
HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol
</p>
<ul>
<li>
an application layer protocol 

<li>
client/server model

<ul>
<li>
client: browser that requests, receives, (using HTTP protocol) and "displays" Web objects, e.g., Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (IE), Firefox, Safari.

<li>
server: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects, e.g., Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS).

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP communication use TCP:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80

<li>
server accepts TCP connection from client

<ul>
<li>
starts a sepaarate thread to process client requests, or allocates one from a thread pool

</ul>
<li>
HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)

<li>
TCP connection close

</ul>

<p>
HTTP - Design Requirements 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entites, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or another event. 

</ul>
  
<ul>
<li>
So we need:

<ul>
<li>
format for messages from client to server, e.g. ask server for stuff or send the server stuff

<li>
format for messages from server to client, e.g. acknowledge request and send data to client, indicate inability to process request.

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
HTTP is "stateless" - server maintains no information about pas client requests

<li>
Two htypes of HTTP messages: request, response

<li>
basic requests: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE

<ul>
<li>
GET: requests a page

<li>
HEAD: similar to GET but noobject returned, just a header

<li>
POST: request a page based on filling out a form

<li>
PUT: upload an object to a server

<li>
DELETE: delete an object from a server

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP request mesaage exmaple
</p>

<ul>
<li>
HTTP request message:

<ul>
<li>
ASCII (human-readable format)

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
HTTP response status codes
</p>

<ul>
<li>
status code appears in 1st line in server-to-client response message.

<li>
200 OK

<li>
301 Moved Permanently

<li>
400 Bad Request

<li>
404 Not Found

<li>
505 HTTP Version Not Suppported

</ul>

<p>
Persistent and Non-persistent HTTP
</p>

<p>
Original HTTP (1.0) - non-persistent HTTP
</p>
<ul>
<li>
at most one object sent over TCP connection

<ul>
<li>
connection then closed

</ul>
<li>
downloading multiple objects required multiple connections

<ul>
<li>
browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Persistent HTTP (1.1) 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client, server

<li>
RFC 7230 family

</ul>

<p>
We will look at RTT (round-trip time) to compare performance time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
</p>


<p>
RTT: time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back
</p>

<p>
HTTP respone time:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
one RTT to initiate TCP connection

<li>
one RTT for HTTP request and a few butes of HTTP response to return

<li>
file transmission time

<li>
non persistent (total) HTTP response time = 2RTT + file transmission time 

</ul>
  
  
<ul>
<li>
Non-persistent HTTP response time:

<ul>
<li>
for every object:

<ul>
<li>
one RTT to initiate TCP connection

<li>
one RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return 

<li>
file transmission time

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Persistent HTTP:

<ul>
<li>
server leaves connection open aafter sending response

<li>
subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection

<li>
client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object 

<li>
as little as one RTT for all the referenced objects

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Evolution of HTTP
</p>

<ul>
<li>
HTTP 2.0 was published in 2015 and is adopted by the major browsers

<ul>
<li>
An update on 1.1 that involves various performance upgrades 

<li>
RFC 7540 

</ul>
</ul>
	  
<ul>
<li>
Any modern web server should implement at least HTTP 1.1

<li>
The majority of web traaffic now is HTTP 1.1 or 2.0

<li>
Exceptions

<ul>
<li>
Some low-tech clients (e.g. Wget) still use 1.0

<li>
Internet chatter indicates that bots often use 1.0

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie"><h3 id="User-server state: Cookie" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie">User-server state: Cookie</a></h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
HTTP provides no provisions for maintaining state 

<li>
However, modern apps often need per-client state

<ul>
<li>
user session state (Web e-mail, online banking)

<li>
authorization

<li>
etc.

</ul>
<li>
This is done using <span id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie-cookies"></span><strong id="cookies">cookies</strong> - formatted text maintained by the browser at the request of a web site

<ul>
<li>
typically maintained in a file on client's computer 

<li>
may include infomration used by application identify a user, such as key to a database entry with account data

</ul>
<li>
Cookies can be a source of privacy and security concerns

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Cookie interaction

<ul>
<li>
server sets a cookie by inclusing <span id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie-Set-cookie header"></span><strong id="Set-cookie header">Set-cookie header</strong> in response to a request

<li>
when sending a request to a server for which it has a stored cookie, client includes <span id="Application Protocols-User-server state: Cookie-Cookie header"></span><strong id="Cookie header">Cookie header</strong> and the associated text

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Cookies components:

<ol>
<li>
Set-cookie header line of HTTP response message

<li>
Cookie header line in next HTTP request message

<li>
Cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser 

<li>
back-end databaase at Web site

</ol>
</ul>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Susan always access Internet from PC

<li>
visits specific e-commerce site for first time

<li>
when initial HTTP requests arrives at site, site creates:

<ul>
<li>
unique ID

<li>
entry in backend database for ID

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Web Cookies: keeping "state"
</p>

<ul>
<li>
What cookies can be used for:

<ul>
<li>
authorization

<li>
shopping carts

<li>
recommendations

<li>
user session state (Web e-mail, onine banking)

</ul>
<li>
How to keep state:

<ul>
<li>
protocol endpoints: maintain state at sender/receiver over multiple transactions

<li>
cookies: http messages carry state

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
cookies and privacy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you

<li>
you may supply name and e-mail to sites

</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-Web caches (proxy server)"><h3 id="Web caches (proxy server)" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-Web caches (proxy server)">Web caches (proxy server)</a></h3></div>

<p>
goal: satisfy client request without involving origin server
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Client may configure browser to use proxy:

<ul>
<li>
all HTTP requests sent to proxy

<li>
if proxy has fresh copy of requested page, it returns stored copy

<li>
if not, it sends its owen GET request to retrieve page from "origin server", sends page to client anad stores a copy

</ul>
<li>
What about pages that may change?

<ul>
<li>
origin server can place limit on time object can be cached

<li>
proxy can issue conditional GET - "If-modified-since:" header

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Cache acts as both client and server:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
server for original requesting client

<li>
client to origin server

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
typically cache is installed by ISP (university, company, residential ISP)

<li>
why web caching?

<ul>
<li>
reduce response time for client request

<li>
reduce traffic on institution's access link

<li>
internet dense with caches: enables "poor" content providers to effectively deliver conent (so too does P2P file sharing)

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-Electronic mail"><h3 id="Electronic mail" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-Electronic mail">Electronic mail</a></h3></div>

<p>
Three major components:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
user agents

<li>
mail servers

<li>
simple mail transfer protocol: SMTP

</ol>

<p>
User Agent
</p>
<ul>
<li>
aka "mail reader"

<li>
composing, editing, reading mail messaaages

<li>
e.g. Outlook, Thunderbird

<li>
outgoing, incoming messages stored on server

</ul>

<p>
Mail servers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
mailbox contains incoming messages for user

<li>
message queue of outgoing (to be sent) mail messages

<li>
SMTP protocol between mail servers to send email messages:

<ul>
<li>
client: sending mail server

<li>
"server": receiving mail server

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Electronic Mail: SMTP [RFC 2821]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
uses TCP to reliably traansfer email message from client to server, port 25

<li>
direct transfer: sending server to reeceiving server

<li>
three phases of tranasfer

<ul>
<li>
handshaking (Greeting)

<li>
transfer of messages

<li>
closure

</ul>
<li>
command/response interaction (like HTTP)

<ul>
<li>
commands: ASCII text

<li>
response: status code and phrase

</ul>
<li>
messages must be in 7-bit ASCII

</ul>

<p>
Scenario: Alice sends message to Bob
</p>

<ol>
<li>
alice uses UA to compose message "to" bob@someschool.edu

<li>
Alice's UA sends message to her mail server; message placed in message queue

<li>
client side of SMTP opens TCP connection with Bob's mail server

<li>
SMTP client sends Alice's message over the TCP connection

<li>
Bob's mail server places the message in Bob's mailbox 

<li>
Bob invokes his user agent to read message

</ol>

<p>
SMTP: final words
</p>

<ul>
<li>
SMTP uses persistent connections

<li>
SMTP requires message (header &amp; body) to be in 7-bit ASCII

<li>
SMTP server uses CRLF.CRLF determine end of message

</ul>

<p>
comparison with HTTP:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
HTTP: pull

<li>
SMTP: push

<li>
both have ASCII command/response interaction, status codes

<li>
HTTP: each object encapsulated in its own response message

<li>
SMTP: multiple objects sent in multipart message

</ul>

<p>
Mail access protocols
</p>

<ul>
<li>
SMTP: delivery/storage to receiver's server

<li>
mail access protocol: retrieval from server

<ul>
<li>
POP: post office protocol [RFC 1939]: authorization, download, using port 110 (non-encrypted port) by default or port 995 (using POP3 securely)

<li>
IMAP: Internet Mail Access Protocol [RFC 1730]: more features, includnig manipulation of stored messages on server , using port 13 (non-encrypted port) by default or port 993 (using POP3 securely)

<li>
HTTP: gmail, hotmail

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Application Protocols-POP3 protocol"><h3 id="POP3 protocol" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-POP3 protocol">POP3 protocol</a></h3></div>

<p>
Authorization phase
</p>
<ul>
<li>
client commands:

<ul>
<li>
user: declare username

<li>
pass: password

</ul>
<li>
server responses:

<ul>
<li>
+OK

<li>
-ERR

</ul>
<li>
Transaction phase, client:

<ul>
<li>
list: list message numbers

<li>
retr: retrieve messge by number

<li>
dele: delete

<li>
quit

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
"plaintext" password over the network

<div id="Application Protocols-Domain Name System (DNS)"><h3 id="Domain Name System (DNS)" class="header"><a href="#Application Protocols-Domain Name System (DNS)">Domain Name System (DNS)</a></h3></div>

<p>
People: many unique identifiers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
SIN, name, driver's license #, passport #

</ul>
<p>
Internet hosts, routers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
IP address (32 bit) - used for addressing datagrams

<li>
"name", e.g., www.uoguelph.ca - used by humans

</ul>
<p>
We need to map between IP addresses and name, and vice verse
</p>

<p>
Solution: Domain Name System (DNS)
</p>

<p>
DNS: Components
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Generaal service: looking up an IP address using a humanly readable name (and vice versa)

<ul>
<li>
Address/name translation

</ul>
<li>
Components:

<ul>
<li>
A naming system that reflects

<ul>
<li>
some properties of the host

<li>
network hierarchy (potentially)

</ul>
<li>
Distributed database implemented in hierarchy of many name servsers

<ul>
<li>
Need to design the database

</ul>
<li>
Protocol: hosts, name servers communicate to resolve names - texr message exchange

<ul>
<li>
need a format for requests and responses

<li>
transport-layer protocol: DNS uses UDP and TCP

<li>
Usually port 53

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
DNS: services, structure
</p>

<p>
DNS services
</p>
<ul>
<li>
hostname to IP address translation

<li>
host aliasing

<ul>
<li>
canonical, alias names

</ul>
<li>
mail server aliasing

<li>
load distribution

<ul>
<li>
replicated

</ul>
<li>
Web servers: 

<ul>
<li>
many IP addresses correspond to one name

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Why not centralize DNS?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
single point of failure

<li>
traffic volume

<li>
distant centralized database

<li>
maintenance

</ul>

<p>
A: doesn't scale!
</p>

<p>
DNS: a distributed, hierarchical database
</p>

<p>
client wants IP for amazon.com; 1st approximation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
client queries root server to find com DNS server

<li>
client queries .com DNS server to get amazon.comDNS server

<li>
client queries amazon.com DNS server to get IP address for www.amaazon.com

</ul>

<p>
DNS: root name servers
</p>

<ul>
<li>
contacted by local name server that can not resolve name

<li>
root name server:

<ul>
<li>
contacts authoritative name server if name mapping not known 

<li>
gets mapping

<li>
returns mapping to local name server

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
TLD, authoritative servers
</p>

<p>
Top-level domain (TLD) servers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
responsible fro com, org, net, edu, aero, jobs, museums, and all top-level country domains, e.g.: uk, fra, ca, jp

<li>
network solutions maintains servers for .com TLD

<li>
Educause for .edu TLD

</ul>

<p>
Authoritative DNS servers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Organization's own DNS server(s), providing authoritative hostname to IP mapping for organization's named hosts

<li>
can be maintained by organization or service provider

</ul>

<p>
Local DNS name server
</p>

<ul>
<li>
does not strictly belong to hierarchy

<li>
each ISP has one

<ul>
<li>
also called "default name server"

</ul>
<li>
when host makes DNS query, query is sent to its local DNS server

<ul>
<li>
has local cache of recent naame-to-address translation pairs (but may be out of date!)

<li>
acts as proxy, forwards query into hierarchy

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
DNS name resolution example 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
host at cis.poly.edu wants IP address for gaia.cs.umass.edu

</ul>

<p>
iterated query:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
contacted server replies with name of server to contact

<li>
"I don't know this but ask this server"

</ul>

<p>
recursive query:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
puts burden of name resolution on contacted name server

<li>
heavy load at upper levels of hierarchy?

</ul>

<p>
DNS: caching, updating records
</p>
<ul>
<li>
once (any) name server learns mapping, it caches mapping

<ul>
<li>
cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time (TTL) 

<ul>
<li>
Time-to-live, or TTL

</ul>
<li>
TLD servers typicaly cached in local name servers

<ul>
<li>
thus root name servers are not often visited

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Cached entries may be out-of-daate (best effort name-to-address translaation!)

<ul>
<li>
if name host changes IP address, may not be known Internet-wide until all TTLs expire

</ul>
<li>
update/notify mechanisms proposed IETF standard 

<ul>
<li>
RFC 2136

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
DNS records
</p>

<p>
DNS: distributed database storing resource records (RR)
</p>

<p>
RR format: (name, value, type, ttl)
</p>

<p>
type=A
</p>
<ul>
<li>
name is hostname

<li>
value is IP address

</ul>

<p>
type=NS
</p>
<ul>
<li>
name is domain (e.g., foo.com)

<li>
value is hostname of authoritative name server for this domain

</ul>

<p>
type=CNAME
</p>
<ul>
<li>
name is alias name for some "canonical" (the real) name

</ul>
<p>
www.ibm.com is really servereast.backup2.ibm.com
</p>
<ul>
<li>
value is canonical name

</ul>

<p>
type=MX
</p>
<ul>
<li>
value is name of mailserver associated with name

</ul>

<p>
DNS record: Address
</p>

<ul>
<li>
name value A ttl

<li>
type=A (aaddress)

<ul>
<li>
name is hostname

<li>
value is IP address

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
DNS protocol, messages
</p>

<ul>
<li>
query and reply messages, both with same message format

</ul>

<p>
message header:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
identification: 16 bit # for query, reply to query uses same #

<li>
flags:

<ul>
<li>
query or reply

<li>
recursion desfired 
	  recursion available
	  reply is authoritative

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Inserting records into DNS
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Example: new startup "Network Utopia"

<li>
Register name networkuptopia.com at DNS registrar (e.g., Network Solutions)

<ul>
<li>
provide names, IP addresses of authoritative name server (primary and secondary)

<li>
registrar inserts two RR into .com TLD server:

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
create authoritataive server, containing

<ul>
<li>
type A record for your web server

<li>
www.networkuptopia.com;

<li>
type MX resource record for networkutopia.com

</ul>
</ul>
